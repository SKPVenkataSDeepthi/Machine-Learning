# Flight Delay Prediction using Deep Learning
Air travel is an essential part of modern life, but flight delays can cause significant inconvenience for passengers and financial losses for airlines. In this project, we use deep learning to predict flight delays based on historical flight data. We leverage the TensorFlow framework to build a model that can predict how many minutes a flight might be delayed.

# How It Works
Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, excels at learning complex patterns and making decisions. It is particularly well-suited for tasks involving large datasets and complex relationships. In this project, we apply deep learning to predict flight delays by using the following approach:
* Data Collection: We use historical flight data to train our model.
* Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for deep learning.
* Model Building: We use TensorFlow's Sequential Model to build a deep learning model for predicting flight delays.
* Real-time Prediction: The trained model is used to make real-time predictions based on user input.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found at [Kaggle: Flight Delay Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/flight-delay-prediction). Download the dataset and save it as `flight_data_2018_to_2022.csv` for use in this project.

# Key Takeaways
* Impact of Flight Delays: Flight delays are a significant issue affecting both passengers and airlines.
* Deep Learning Model: The Sequential Model from TensorFlow.keras is used for accurate flight delay prediction.
* Data Preprocessing: Understanding and preparing the data is crucial for building an effective model.
* Integration: Flask can be used to integrate the trained model with a web application for real-time predictions.

# Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:
* TensorFlow
