This project demonstrates a complete workflow for text classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset and a Naive Bayes classifier. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results visualization, providing a clear and comprehensive guide to building and understanding a text classification model. The steps include data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
Steps
	1. Import Libraries:
		* Import necessary libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
	2. Load the Dataset:
		* The fetch_20newsgroups function from Scikit-learn is used to load the 20 Newsgroups dataset, which contains text data categorized into 20 different topics.
	3. Print Categories and Number of Classes:
		* Retrieve and print the text categories (class names) to understand the different topics present in the dataset.
		* Print the number of unique classes to see how many distinct categories are present.
	4. Split the Dataset:
		* Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split to ensure that the model can be evaluated on unseen data.
	5. Create a Pipeline:
		* Use make_pipeline to create a pipeline that combines TfidfVectorizer and MultinomialNB. This pipeline handles both the text vectorization and the classification in one step.
		* TfidfVectorizer transforms the text data into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features.
		* MultinomialNB is a Naive Bayes classifier suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts).
	6. Train the Model:
		* Fit the pipeline model on the training data. This step involves learning the parameters of the vectorizer and the classifier.
	7. Make Predictions:
		* Use the trained model to predict the categories of the test data.
	8. Evaluate the Model:
		* Calculate the accuracy of the model, which is the proportion of correctly classified documents.
		* Print a classification report that includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each category, providing a detailed performance evaluation.
		* Compute the confusion matrix to see the counts of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions for each category.
		* Visualize the confusion matrix using a heatmap for better interpretability.
	9. Print Train and Test Data with Categories:
		* Print the categories of documents in the training and test datasets to understand the distribution and examples of data points.
